# Mamba Environment Manager

A comprehensive Python tool for managing mamba/conda environments with automated reinstallation and renaming capabilities.

## Features

- **Export & Reinstall**: Export broken environments to YAML files and reinstall them
- **Smart Renaming**: Rename environments to lowercase with Python/R version suffixes
- **Verification**: Verify successful installation before cleanup
- **Safe Cleanup**: Remove old environments only after successful reinstall
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful recovery
- **Detailed Logging**: All operations logged to file with timestamps
- **Interactive Mode**: User-friendly interface for selective processing
- **Batch Mode**: Automated processing of all environments
- **ðŸ†• YAML Cleanup**: Remove old exported environment files to prevent clutter
- **ðŸ†• Jupyter Kernel Recreation**: Automatically update/create Jupyter kernels for environments

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python environment_manager.py
```
This mode allows you to:
- View all environments with their current and proposed new names
- **Preview changes** before processing (no modifications made)
- Choose to process all environments or select specific ones
- **ðŸ†• Clean up exported YAML files** (Option 4)
- **ðŸ†• Recreate Jupyter kernels** for Python/R environments (Option 5)
- See real-time progress and results
- Review smart naming decisions and conflict resolutions

### Batch Mode (All Environments)
```bash
python batch_process.py
```
Processes all environments automatically after confirmation.

### Test Mode
```bash
python test_manager.py             # Basic functionality test
python test_smart_naming.py        # Test smart naming with real patterns  
python test_package_detection.py   # Test package version detection
python test_new_features.py        # Test new cleanup and kernel features
```
Tests the functionality without making any changes.

## Environment Naming Convention

The tool uses **intelligent naming** that handles existing version patterns gracefully and includes key package versions:

### Smart Cleaning Examples:
- `py_jjans_3.10_scanpy` â†’ `py_jjans_scanpy_py310` âœ… (eliminates duplication)
- `py_jjans_3.7_harmony` â†’ `py_jjans_harmony_py37` âœ… (eliminates duplication)
- `R_jjans_4.2_cistopic` â†’ `r_jjans_cistopic_r42` (cleans and standardizes)
- `neuronchat_r405` â†’ `neuronchat_py310` (detects existing R version, no duplication)
- `scenicplus_v102` â†’ `scenicplus_py311` (removes version suffix)
- `scanpy_analysis` â†’ `scanpy_analysis_scanpy19_py310` (adds detected package version)

### Advanced Features:
1. **Duplication Prevention**: Detects when versions already exist in different formats
2. **Package Version Detection**: Extracts key package versions from YAML exports
3. **Smart Package Mapping**: Recognizes package name variations (harmonypy, harmony, etc.)
4. **Intelligent Cleaning**: Removes redundant version patterns before adding standardized ones

### Naming Rules:
1. **Convert to lowercase**: `MyEnvironment` â†’ `myenvironment`
2. **Clean existing versions**: Removes patterns like `_py3.10`, `_r4.2`, `_v102`
3. **Add package versions**: `_scanpy19`, `_harmonypy00` for key packages
4. **Add standardized language versions**: `_py310`, `_r42` format
5. **Resolve conflicts**: Adds `_v1`, `_v2` suffixes when needed
6. **Preserve meaningful names**: Keeps descriptive parts intact

### Pattern Detection:
The tool automatically detects and handles:
- **Python versions**: `py3.10`, `python3.10`, `_py310`, `py_3.10`, `_3.10`
- **R versions**: `r4.2`, `_r42`, `r_4.2`, `_r_4.2`, `r405`
- **Version suffixes**: `_v1`, `_v102`, `_version2`
- **Package versions**: From both conda and pip dependencies in YAML files

### Package Version Detection:
- Automatically scans exported YAML files for key packages
- Maps environment names to relevant packages (scanpyâ†’scanpy, harmonyâ†’harmonypy)
- Includes up to 2 most relevant package versions to avoid overly long names
- Supports both conda (`package=version=build`) and pip (`package==version`) formats

### Conflict Resolution:
- If `myenv_py39` already exists, new environment becomes `myenv_py39_v1`
- Sequential numbering prevents overwrites
- Safe processing ensures no data loss

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- mamba or conda installed and available in PATH
- PyYAML
- colorama

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python environment_manager.py
   ```

## Configuration

Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py` to customize:
- Tool preference (mamba vs conda)
- Naming conventions
- Directory locations
- Verification settings
- Logging configuration

## Logging

All operations are logged to `environment_manager.log` with:
- Timestamps for all operations
- Detailed error messages
- Success confirmations
- Command outputs when relevant

## Safety Features

- **Backup**: Environments are exported before any changes
- **Verification**: New environments are tested before old ones are removed
- **Error Recovery**: Failed operations don't affect other environments
- **User Confirmation**: Interactive prompts for destructive operations
- **Detailed Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Example Output

```

## New Features (v2.0)

### YAML Cleanup Function
Removes old exported environment files to prevent directory clutter:
```python
# Programmatic usage
manager.cleanup_exported_yaml_files(confirm=False)  # No confirmation
manager.cleanup_exported_yaml_files(confirm=True)   # With confirmation

# Interactive menu: Option 4
```

### Jupyter Kernel Recreation
Updates/creates Jupyter kernels for environments with Python or R:
```python
# Recreate kernels for all environments
manager.recreate_jupyter_kernels()

# Recreate kernels for specific environments
manager.recreate_jupyter_kernels(['env1', 'env2'])

# Interactive menu: Option 5
```

**Kernel Features:**
- Preserves existing kernel configurations (display name, metadata, etc.)
- Updates only the executable path to match environment location
- Supports both Python (`ipykernel`) and R (`IRkernel`) environments
- Creates kernels in user's local Jupyter directory
- Handles kernel conflicts gracefully

**Kernel Locations:**
- **User kernels**: `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/`
- **System kernels**: `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/` (if accessible)
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/`

## Troubleshooting

- **Mamba not found**: The tool automatically falls back to conda
- **Export fails**: Check if the environment is corrupted or has dependency conflicts
- **Import fails**: Review the exported YAML file for invalid dependencies
- **Verification fails**: The new environment may have issues but won't be removed automatically
- **Kernel creation fails**: Check if Jupyter is installed and kernel directories are writable

## Files Created

- `exported_environments/`: YAML exports of original environments
- `backup_environments/`: Installation/removal logs and additional backups
- `environment_manager.log`: Detailed operation log
- `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/`: Created Jupyter kernels

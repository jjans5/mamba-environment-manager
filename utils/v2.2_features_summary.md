# Environment Manager v2.2 - New Features Summary

## ðŸš€ Major Features Added

### 1. Environment Cloning Tool (`utils/environment_cloner.py`)

**Two Cloning Methods:**
- **conda-pack**: Creates portable tar.gz archives for exact environment replication
- **YAML**: Cross-platform compatible environment recreation

**Key Features:**
- Automatic method detection (conda-pack preferred, YAML fallback)
- Smart naming with auto-generated names based on Python/R versions
- Support for environment paths or names as input
- Interactive creation option for YAML method

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Clone with auto-detection
python utils/environment_cloner.py myenv auto

# Clone with conda-pack
python utils/environment_cloner.py myenv new_env --method conda-pack

# Clone with YAML export
python utils/environment_cloner.py myenv new_env --method yaml
```

### 2. Enhanced Log Analyzer (`utils/simple_log_analyzer.py`)

**Advanced Debugging:**
- Environment-specific failure analysis with full context
- Error categorization and pattern recognition
- Line number tracking for easy log navigation
- Debugging suggestions based on error types

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Analyze all failures
python utils/simple_log_analyzer.py

# Debug specific environment
python utils/simple_log_analyzer.py myenv

# Interactive debugging
python utils/simple_log_analyzer.py --debug
```

### 3. Integrated Main Interface

**New Menu Options:**
- **Option 7**: Clone environment (conda-pack or YAML)
- **Option 8**: Debug environment failures
- **Option 9**: Analyze log failures

**Smart Integration:**
- Graceful fallback when utilities not available
- Error handling for missing dependencies
- Consistent UI with existing features

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### conda-pack Integration
- Automatic detection of conda-pack availability
- Portable archive creation with progress tracking
- Deployment instructions for target machines
- Fallback to YAML method when conda-pack unavailable

### Debugging Infrastructure
- Context-aware log parsing
- Error type classification
- Suggestion engine for common issues
- Interactive debugging sessions

### Code Architecture
- Modular design with standalone utilities
- Import safety with graceful fallbacks
- Consistent error handling across components
- CLI interfaces for all new tools

## ðŸ“š Documentation Updates

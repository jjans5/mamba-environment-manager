# Enhanced Environment Deletion with List Input Support

## Overview
Added a comprehensive environment deletion feature to the Environment Manager with list input support, safety protections, and clear warnings about permanent deletion.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Menu Option  
- Added option 8 in the main menu: "[DELETE] Delete environments"
- Updated menu numbering (EXIT moved to option 11)
- Integrated seamlessly with existing menu system

### 2. List Input Format Support
```
Examples:
[1,3,5]     - Delete environments 1, 3, and 5
[2,4-7]     - Delete environment 2 and range 4-7  
[1,3-5,8]   - Delete 1, range 3-5, and 8
1,3,5       - Same as [1,3,5] (brackets optional)
```

### 3. Safety Protections
- **Base Environment Protection**: base/root environments automatically excluded from deletion
- **Double Confirmation**: Two-step confirmation process for safety
  1. Type 'DELETE' to confirm
  2. Type 'yes' for final confirmation
- **Clear Warnings**: Multiple warnings about permanent deletion
- **Empty Input Cancellation**: Empty input safely cancels the operation

### 4. Enhanced Environment Display
- Shows environments with numbers, Python versions, and full paths
- Format: `1. environment_name (Python 3.10) - /full/path/to/environment`
- Clear safety warnings displayed prominently
- Only shows deletable environments (excludes base/root)

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Validates number ranges (1 <= number <= total_environments)
- Handles invalid input gracefully with helpful error messages
- Supports both bracketed `[1,3,5]` and unbracketed `1,3,5` formats
- Timeout protection for deletion operations (5 minutes)

## Implementation Details

### New Methods

#### `_handle_delete_environments()`
- **Location**: `environment_manager.py` lines ~1775-1884
- **Purpose**: Handle environment deletion with list input support
- **Features**:
  - Parse list/range input formats
  - Safety protections and warnings
  - Double confirmation system
  - Deletion progress tracking
  - Summary reporting

#### `_delete_environment(env_name: str) -> bool`
- **Location**: `environment_manager.py` lines ~1886-1921
- **Purpose**: Actually delete a single environment using conda/mamba
- **Features**:
  - Uses `conda env remove --name env_name --yes`
  - 5-minute timeout protection
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Returns success/failure status

### Range Parsing Logic
```python
# Supports: [1,3-5,7] -> [1,3,4,5,7]
for part in number_str.split(','):
    if '-' in part:
        start, end = map(int, part.split('-'))
        selected_numbers.extend(range(start, end + 1))
    else:
        selected_numbers.append(int(part))
```

### Safety Implementation
```python
# Filter out base environments for safety
safe_environments = [env for env in environments if env['name'] not in ['base', 'root']]

# Double confirmation required
confirm1 = input("Type 'DELETE' to confirm deletion: ").strip()
if confirm1 != 'DELETE':
    return
    
confirm2 = input("Are you absolutely sure? (yes/NO): ").strip().lower()
if confirm2 != 'yes':
    return
```

## User Experience

### Safety-First Design
```
=== üóëÔ∏è  Delete Environments ===
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone!

Available environments for deletion:
   1. environment1 (Python 3.10) - /path/to/env1
   2. environment2 (Python 3.11) - /path/to/env2

Enter environment numbers to delete:
Examples: [1,3,5] or [2,4-7] or [1,3,5-8]
‚ö†Ô∏è  Use caution - this will permanently delete the selected environments!
Environment numbers: [1,2]

‚ö†Ô∏è  DANGER: The following environments will be PERMANENTLY DELETED:
  üóëÔ∏è  environment1 - /path/to/env1
  üóëÔ∏è  environment2 - /path/to/env2

This action cannot be undone!
Type 'DELETE' to confirm deletion: DELETE
Are you absolutely sure? (yes/NO): yes

üóëÔ∏è  Deleting environment: environment1
  ‚úÖ Successfully deleted environment1
üóëÔ∏è  Deleting environment: environment2  
  ‚úÖ Successfully deleted environment2

=== Deletion Summary ===
‚úÖ Successfully deleted: 2 environments
üéâ Environment deletion completed!
```

### Error Handling Examples
- **Invalid input**: "Invalid number format: invalid literal for int()"
- **Out of range**: "Warning: Number 10 is out of range"
- **No selection**: "No valid environments selected"
- **Cancelled**: "Deletion cancelled - confirmation failed"
- **Empty input**: "No input provided - cancelling deletion"

## Usage Flow
1. Select option 8 (DELETE) from main menu
2. View numbered environment list with safety warnings
3. Enter list format: `[1,3,5]` or `2,4-6` etc.
4. Review what will be deleted
5. Type 'DELETE' to confirm
6. Type 'yes' for final confirmation
7. Watch deletion progress and summary

## Technical Benefits
- **Safety First**: Multiple layers of protection against accidental deletion
- **User Friendly**: Clear prompts, examples, and warning system
- **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling and timeout protection
- **Efficient**: List input allows bulk operations
- **Integrated**: Uses existing environment discovery and command infrastructure
- **Logged**: All operations logged for audit trail

## Files Modified
- `environment_manager.py`: Added `_handle_delete_environments()` and `_delete_environment()` methods, updated menu

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Menu navigation working
- ‚úÖ Environment detection and display working  
- ‚úÖ Safety protections working (base environment excluded)
- ‚úÖ List input parsing working
- ‚úÖ Range expansion working
- ‚úÖ Double confirmation system working
- ‚úÖ Error handling working
- ‚úÖ Empty input cancellation working

## Demo Available
Run `python demo_environment_deletion.py` for feature summary or `python demo_environment_deletion.py --demo` for safe interactive demonstration.

## Safety Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Environment deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Always ensure you have backups of important environments before deletion.

The feature includes multiple safety mechanisms:
- Base/root environment protection
- Double confirmation requirement  
- Clear deletion warnings
- Full path display
- Empty input cancellation
- Operation logging
